			<p>An interesting hypothesis I have for this dataset is: For restaurants that have been re-inspected, the total number of critical violations is lower upon the next re-inspections, compared the the original inspection. This data comes from the <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Onondaga-County-Restaurant-Inspections/tbxv-5tbd/about_data" target="_blank">Onondaga County Health Department's Restaurant Inspections Database.<a/> I think this is a good hypothesis because it allows us to see if the system of restaurant inspections encourages foodservice facilities to cut down on their violations, or if they continue unchanged.</p>
