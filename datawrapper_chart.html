			<p>This dataviz plots out the wards in Syracuse with the highest percentage of poor or very poor quality roads. This is part of a larger story on what specific neighborhoods have undermaintained roads.</p>

		<section>
			<p>After making this chart, I got some very good feedback from my partner. One, I misidentified my finding in the data- the sixth ward has the highest percentage, not the fourth. Two, my subheading was quite short. Lastly, I didn't have a link to the original data.</p>

		<!-- Explain what you changed on your chart here, and why. -->
		<section>
			<p>I first changed my heading to reflect the accurate data finding. Next, I reworked my subheading to be a little more descriptive so it can stand alone. Lastly, I added a link and attribution to the SMTC and Open Data Syracuse.</p>
