			<li>1. <strong>How is this data organized and collected?</strong> This data has been organized in a data table with the 50 states and U.S. territories down one side, with each one being broken down into health center related data. This data was collected by the National Association of Health Centers, an advocacy organization for federally funded health centers. Since these centers are an extension of the federal government, the data is avaliable.</li>
			<li>2. <strong>Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?</strong> This data is newsworthy because under the current presidential administration, Medicare and Medicaid programs are in jeopardy. Many congresspeople in D.C. who are against these programs are Republicans who represent states with a higher poverty rate, where these programs are vital.</li>
			<li>3. <strong>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?</strong> States with Republican representatives and senators have a higher Medicare/Medicaid using percentage than states with majority Democratic representatives and senators.</li></p>

			<li>1. <strong>How is this data organized and collected?</strong> This data is organized in a simple item/cost table. The data was collected from the Hartford, Connecticut police department, a city near my hometown. Since the data regards spending from the department, it was likely on hand from budget documents.</li>
			<li>2. <strong>Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?</strong> I think this data set, although small, is quite newsworthy because over $600,000 is a lot for one police unit to spend on gear in a year, and the taxpayers of Hartford are the ones paying for it. They would also be the target audience.</li>
			<li>3. <strong>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?</strong> The spending for one year of Hartford PD Swat gear resulted in lower crime in comparison to years with lower spending.</li></p>
