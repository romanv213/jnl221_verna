			<p>One thing I was surprised about in the documentary is how far AI goes beyond what the average person may think. For many students, including myself, AI is thought of as a way to do homework easily or to help us in everyday tasks. The documentary exposes how there is a complete other side to AI, which is mostly used privately. A quote I thought was impactful was from the MIT researcher who made the discovery that women and people with dark skin are often profiled by AI. Buolamwini says “The people who are most vulnerable in society are also the people who are most likely to be misclassified by these systems” which I think sums up the problem at hand, that AI takes advantage of existing biases and not only uses them, but promotes them.</p>
			<p>I think it’s interesting to look at pop culture from the 2000s-2010s and how AI was portrayed then. One of my favorite movies as a kid was Wall-E, where the world has become uninhabitable and humans all live on a spaceship run by robots. An “AI” robot takes over control of the ship and refuses to give it back. However, this portrayal is different from what AI is nowadays. We still live in a world where we control AI- not the other way around. After watching the documentary, I found it interesting that while we may think of AI as something that can take over the world, it’s actually more likely to turn ourselves against each other, and rather cause harm that way. If AI promotes biases against sexes, races, or any other group, those flawed opinions are then thought of as fact, and create a very hostile world. We must keep it in check, as the documentary suggests, and use it ethically.<p>
			<p>Two questions I would have while interviewing this dataset are 1) What regions are the least represented in this dataset, and do those governments have a history of limiting public data access? And 2) Is there a difference in the representation of physical incidents (self-driving car accidents, etc.) vs. biases (racial profiling, etc.) in the dataset? I think one of the most severe issues in this dataset regards self-driving cars, because problems with AI in those can cause harm to any group. From that, my hypothesis is that vehicles that use AI are more likely to cause physical harm to either people inside the vehicle or pedestrians than normal vehicles driven by humans.<p>
