			<p>One very interesting data set I found through FOIA on Muckrock was a list of police departments that searched through a database of license plates. The database was from a department in Illinois, but departments that searched the database were from across the country, even here in Syracuse. This raises questions about what organizations can search data like this, such as ICE or organizations that may have an ulterior motive to needing personal information. I think it would be very interesting to see Syracuse's full data set, and this could be something that we get by FOIAing the department.</p>
